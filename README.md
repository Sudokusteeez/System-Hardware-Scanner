# System-Information-Scanner

# Overview:
The System Information Scanner is a Python-based project designed to gather essential system information, such as architecture, network name, operating system details, CPU specifications, and RAM capacity. It provides a quick and convenient way to access and display vital system-related data.

# Languages & Programs Used:
Python &
Visual Studio Code

# Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly system information scanner that can quickly provide essential details about the system. This tool serves as a valuable resource for understanding the system's hardware and software configuration and can be used for system diagnostics and troubleshooting.

# Key Features:
Architecture Information: Displays whether the system is running on a 64-bit or 32-bit architecture.
Network Name: Shows the network name or hostname of the system.
Operating System Details: Provides information about the operating system, including version and build.
Processor Specifications: Displays the full CPU name, clock speed, and other relevant details.
RAM Capacity: Shows the total RAM capacity in gigabytes (GB).
GPU Information: Provides details about the installed graphics processing unit.

# Skills Gained:
Utilization of platform, psutil, cpuinfo, and wmi libraries to gather system information.
Understanding and application of Python programming concepts for system analysis and data display.

# Usage:
*  Clone the repository to your local machine.
*  Install the required dependencies using pip:
*  Enter the following in cmd line: pip install psutil cpuinfo wmi
*  Run the Python script to gather and display system information.
*  Observe the output as the script provides essential details about the system.
